						<p>The hotel's architectural design was performed by Hong Kong-based Rocco Design Architects Ltd., which was awarded the 2011 Hong Kong Institute of Architects Medal of the Year of Hong Kong for this work.[2] Hong Kong's CL3 Architects designed the interiors, including the guestrooms, the Silverbox ballroom and the lobby's grand staircase. </p>

						<p>On the first floor, Silverbox Ballroom  designed by William Lim offers a magnificent setting. No traditional chandeliers can be seen - but the ultra-modern latticework of crystal glass suggests a contemporary interpretation of the classic ballroom. The state of the art sound and infinitely controllable lighting system, as well as a variety of cuisine options, will ensure your event is staged in dazzling style.  It can also be divided into smaller spaces to cater for other types of events including corporate and academic functions such as meetings, conferences and exhibitions and private events such as wedding banquets and charity balls.</p>
